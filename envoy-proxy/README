-> Definition: Envoy is a high performance C++ distributed proxy designed for single services and applications,
as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures.

-> Usage: gRPC-Web clients connect to gRPC services via a special gateway proxy: the current version of the library uses Envoy by default,
in which gRPC-Web support is built-in.

-> Basically envoy proxy will convert the http1.1 requests to http/2 grpc requests and will forward them to our
grpc node service
